## Abstract
<p align = "justify">The aim of this project is to solve a given 2D maze (given as an image input) using RL (Q-Learning) algorithm. The program first processes the image input of the maze and converts it into a matrix. The Q-Learning algorithm then uses this matrix to generate a q-matrix, which is finally used to get the shortest path. The program can also generate random mazes and then solve it.</p>

## Motivation
<p align = "justify">Reinforcement learning in robotics has been a challenging domain in the field of AI for the past few years. The ability to equip a robot with a powerful enough tool to allow an autonomous discovery of an optimal behavior through trial-and-error interactions with its environment has paved the path to many deep research projects.<br></br>
Our project inspires us to solve many problems, like Autonomous Mobile Robot Obstacle Prevention using Q-learning.</p>
